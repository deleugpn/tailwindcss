## Hi, I'm Marco :)

I'm a 31-year-old Brazilian software engineer
that has been working with PHP since 2010 and
Laravel since 5.0 (2015). My primary experience
comes from working for one Brazilian company
for 6 years and one Dutch company for the past
7 years. I relocated to The Netherlands in 2017
and came back to Brazil to work fully remote
in 2022.

Enough about what you can see on my resume.
Let's talk about what's important.

#### Why I want this job

The first thing that excites me about the position 
is the salary. Let's be honest, that's double what
I make today. Being a Brazilian whose first job 
(at age 14) was making US$10/week (30h/week),
this is a generational impact. That money means
I don't need side hustle and I would be able
to solely focus on the two love of my life:
my family and my profession.

Another huge exciting thing about this is
working closely with the best players in
software engineering in the world. Adam
and Taylor has completely changed the lives
of a lot of humans and has changed the direction
of software engineering. It doesn't matter
whether you hate or love Tailwind or Laravel,
it's indisputable that software engineering will
never be the same since these folks released
their projects into the world. That kind of
accomplishment requires a certain level of **passion**
that is rare and excites me have in a workplace.

Lastly, I think frontend work has improved incredibly
in the last 5 years. Still, it's not as easy as
getting started with Laravel, Livewire and Tailwind.
Evan You has been changing that with Vue, Vite, Vitest,
Rolldown, etc, but there is room for improving the
developer experience and Tailwind has been part of that
change. It's the difference between a poor kid from
a 3rd world country being able to pick up life changing
skills or forever staying in an underdeveloped 
socioeconomic state.

#### Interesting Projects & Previous Experience

I have been primarily focused on backend development 
for most of my career. Last year I made some changes
to bring in Inertia, Vue and Tailwind into my team
so my experience with fullstack development and/or
frontend and designing is rather limited. However,
I have worked a lot with CI/CD, infrastructure, 
AWS and DevOps in general. I cannot explain to you
O(n) or O(log n) notations, but in my own way I 
understand why a loop inside a loop consumes a lot
more CPU than if the same goal can be accomplished 
using access patterns in indexed data due to memory
access efficiency.

For the past 3 years I have been working closely
with a team of 1 Product Manager, 1 Jack-of-all-trades 
(PM Jr, QA, Release Manager, Jr Frontend Dev), 1
Sr backend and 1 Mid frontend. I have been leading them,
leading the architecture, sharing knowledge, doing code
review, helping them improve their tests and quality
of their code while also keeping our eyes open to
what the Product Manager (and the business) actually
need. At the end of the day, if we are super excited
about what we built, but it's useless to our users
and business, then our beautiful project will not
see the light of day. We must strive to keep it
simple, keep it beautiful but also keep it useful
and user-focused.

In 2015, I worked for a US B2B e-commerce company that
was suffering massive performance issues because
of their database full of products. It was my first
contact with MySQL `EXPLAIN` query and understanding
indexes. 2 days of research and a couple of database
indexes made such a big impact into the system performance
that the company unlock the ability to scale and sell
a lot more licenses to businesses.

In 2013, I worked for a couple of months with Arduino
in a Remote Vigilance project and one of my biggest
accomplishment was to create a Web Page (PHP) that
when you click a button, an LED light turns on
in an Arduino device running on the local network.
Back then, I had 0 knowledge of electrical engineering,
so I didn't know how to transform that into the ability
of opening and closing a security gate, but that's where
teamwork came to play. I just had to turn on/off the LED
and leave to the electrician to change the LED electric pulse
into a signal that would activate a battery that opens and
closes a car gate.

My first big project when moving to the Netherlands (2017)
was about transforming a successful startup into a maintainable
project. They used to have about 75 EC2 instances running
across US, Europe and Australia. I remember that in my first 
week at the company, they were talking about EC2 instance and
I didn't even know what that was since I had never worked with 
AWS before. I went from a newbie to containerizing the application,
building CI/CD pipelines, establishing continuous deployment,
running up to 150 AWS Fargate containers across those 3 regions.
I was also responsible for bringing Laravel, automation testing 
practices (Thanks Adam and Jeffrey!), Code Review, etc. I have
worked with advanced analytics database querying as-a-service,
importing CSV data, admin management tools, integrations with 
Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics and a lot more.

#### Open-source contributions


> Edit: I almost forgot to include my biggest OSS contribution ðŸ˜±:
https://github.com/brefphp/bref/pull/1078
> 
> This PR looks closed, but it's just because Matthiew continued
the work in a different repository, but all the months of work
I spent on understanding PHP Extensions, `.so` files, 
AWS internals for Lambda, etc. have all been to great use.
Matthiew has LOVED the automation testing practices I brought
into testing AWS Lambda layers using Docker.


I have quite a few contributions, I'm going to divide this into
a short list for primary focus and a more extensive list for
completeness.

#### Technical writing

You may browse my blog at https://blog.deleu.dev/ which
is the best place to get an overall idea of my technical
writing skills. I don't write very often, but I always
strive to write meaningful content with a personalized
experience. Since your time is limited, I'm going
to try and narrow it down:

- Teaching Concepts: https://blog.deleu.dev/aws-vpc-for-software-engineers/
- Sharing frustration: https://blog.deleu.dev/my-first-contact-with-esm-and-cjs/
- A pinch of Security: https://blog.deleu.dev/swapping-laravel-encryption-with-aws-kms/

#### Conclusion

I love my profession and I don't like job-swapping. You'll see
a few jobs in my resume, but that's because sometimes I have
freelancing work to make an extra cash. In reality, I have
worked for 1 company for 6 years in Brazil and 1 company for
7 years in The Netherlands. I'm not great with CSS and designing,
but the Staff position seems to be a lot more focused on the tooling,
developer experience and help build Tailwind inside than actually
designing screens. If you're looking for somebody for a long-term
commitment, I may be able to bring original thinking, vast experience,
excitement, eagerness to learn and a lot of passion. I sometimes
may also bring a bit of stubbornness, impulsivity and aversion
to authority, although therapy has been helping me learn about
my emotions and keep these things in check. I'm sure I have a
billion things to learn at a company like Tailwind, but I might
also have something to bring to the table. 

I love Steve Jobs' quote: 

> It doesn't make sense to hire smart people and then tell them
> what to do. We hire smart people so they can tell us what to do.
